Date: Feb 14, 2026 ~10:00 PM

Attendees: ${world.people.map((p) => p.name).join(", ")}

Idea: Always-on AI that passively captures audio and builds a searchable knowledge graph.

Discussion:
- ${world.people[0]?.name}: "What if your AI just... listened to everything and remembered it for you?"
- ${world.people[3]?.name}: "I can build the Whisper pipeline on Modal. Real-time transcription is doable."
- ${world.people[2]?.name}: "Love the concept but how do we demo 'always on' in a browser?"
- ${world.people[1]?.name}: "Chrome has MediaRecorder API. But background recording is hard."

Technical notes:
- Whisper large-v3 for transcription (tested: 1.8s for 30s clip)
- Supabase + pgvector for semantic storage
- Web Audio API for capture (foreground only)
- GPT-4o for fact extraction from transcripts

Risks flagged by ${editor.name}:
- iOS/Safari doesn't support background audio
- Chrome kills service workers after 30s inactivity
- Privacy UX — how do you show "I'm recording" without being creepy?
- Battery drain on laptops

Decision: Let's prototype for 2-3 hours. If we can't get background audio working, we pivot.`,

      content: `OpenAI Hackathon 2026 — ADR: Specialized Agent Architecture
Date: Feb 15, 2026 ~1:00 AM

Status: SUPERSEDED (pivoted to GhostWorker)

Context:
After abandoning the ambient listener, we decided to build an "AI Workforce" — a team of specialized AI agents, each fine-tuned on a domain.

Architecture:
1. Coordinator Agent: Classifies intent, routes to specialist
2. Specialist Agents: Legal, Finance, Engineering, Product
3. Each specialist has LoRA fine-tuned weights for domain expertise
4. Agents can consult each other via message-passing protocol

Decision Rationale:
- ${world.people[3]?.name} advocated strongly for fine-tuning (experience from Sarvam AI)
- ${world.people[0]?.name} pushed back — iteration too slow for hackathon format
- ${world.people[2]?.name} concerned about demo impact — "what does the user SEE?"

What We Learned:
- LoRA fine-tuning on Modal takes ~20 min per agent
- Can't iterate fast enough in a 12-hour hackathon
- System prompts + RAG can approximate "specialization" without fine-tuning
- The agent-to-agent communication protocol was actually good — reusing in GhostWorker

Decision: Pivot to GhostWorker (AI-native memory layer) at ~3:30 AM.
Keep: agent coordination code, Whisper pipeline
Discard: LoRA training setup, domain-specific datasets`,

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Where we agree:
• GhostWorker is the right idea for THIS hackathon (demoable, novel enough, real integrations)
• The pivot journey is an asset, not a liability — show it in the demo narrative
• Live Slack learning is the "wow moment" for judges
• We need approach B for auth (shared OAuth)

Where we disagree:
• Scope: Angelina wants full vision (8 features), James/Ella want to cut to 3-4 polished ones, Videet is neutral but leaning toward reliability
• Risk tolerance: Angelina is comfortable with some features being rough, Ella wants everything bulletproof
• What to emphasize: James wants CEO insights first (visual impact), Angelina wants clone chat first (personal experience), Videet wants live learning first (technical impressiveness)

Decision: We'll show 5 features in order: CEO insights → clone chat → live learning → onboarding brief → agent visualization. James presents, Angelina controls the laptop.`,

      title: "GhostWorker — Ideas We Killed and Why (Learning Log)",
      content: `Ideas We Killed and Why — OpenAI Hackathon 2026

This is a record of every idea we considered, who advocated for it, and why we ultimately moved on. Writing this for posterity and so the clones have context.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IDEA 1: Ambient Listening AI (9:30 PM - 12:30 AM)

Champion: Videet
${world.people.find(p => p.id === "u_videet")?.opinions?.[0] || ""}

Skeptic: James
${world.people.find(p => p.id === "u_james")?.opinions?.[1] || ""}

Why we killed it:
- Chrome kills background audio service workers after 30 seconds (by design)
- iOS Safari has no background audio API at all
- The "always listening" UX felt creepy and would have been polarizing with judges
- After 3 hours, best we had was a glorified voice recorder

What survived: Whisper transcription pipeline (reused for GhostWorker voice mode)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IDEA 2: AI Workforce — Specialized Agents (1:00 AM - 3:30 AM)

Champion: Videet
${world.people.find(p => p.id === "u_videet")?.opinions?.[1] || ""}

Skeptic: James
${world.people.find(p => p.id === "u_james")?.opinions?.[2] || ""}

Product perspective (Angelina):
${world.people.find(p => p.id === "u_angelina")?.opinions?.[6] || ""}

Why we killed it:
- LoRA fine-tuning takes 20+ minutes per agent on Modal A100
- Only 3 iteration cycles possible before demo — not enough for good quality
- "Specialization" was hard to demonstrate visually in 3 minutes
- Judges would ask "how is this different from different system prompts?" and we didn't have a great answer

What survived: Agent-to-agent communication protocol (reused for clone consultation in GhostWorker)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IDEA 3: GhostWorker — AI-Native Memory Layer (3:30 AM - present) ✅ SHIPPED

Why this won:
- James: "${world.people.find(p => p.id === "u_james")?.opinions?.[0]?.slice(0, 200) || "The memory layer concept is technically novel but also extremely demoable."}"
- Ella: "${world.people.find(p => p.id === "u_ella")?.opinions?.[0]?.slice(0, 200) || "GhostWorker is a great idea but we need to focus on reliability."}"
- Angelina: "${world.people.find(p => p.id === "u_angelina")?.opinions?.[0]?.slice(0, 200) || "GhostWorker has the potential to be a real product."}"
- Videet: "${world.people.find(p => p.id === "u_videet")?.opinions?.[2]?.slice(0, 200) || "The memory layer concept is sound."}"

Key decisions made for GhostWorker:
1. Supabase + pgvector over a separate vector DB (Ella's call — simpler, cheaper, good enough)
2. text-embedding-3-small over large (Videet's call — faster, 1536-d is sufficient)
3. Cursor-inspired dark theme (Angelina's call — she works there, knows the aesthetic)
4. CEO insights as demo opener (James's call — visually impressive, shows multi-agent power)
5. Show 5 features not 8 (compromise between James's 3 and Angelina's 8)
6. Shared OAuth for Drive + Gmail (Ella's call, everyone agreed)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Meta-reflection:
The fact that we killed two ideas and still shipped a strong product in 6 hours says something about the team. Two IOAI gold medalists (Angelina + Videet), a SAIL researcher and OpenAI Hackathon organizer (James), and a full-stack engineer who made all the integrations actually work (Ella). Different perspectives, healthy disagreements, but ultimately converged on something we're all proud of.`,

      title: "GhostWorker — 5 AM Standup Notes",
      content: `5 AM Standup — GhostWorker Build Sprint
Attendees: James, Ella, Angelina, Videet

JAMES (ML & Backend):
• RAG pipeline: ✅ working. chunks + embeds + searches correctly.
• Clone chat: ✅ streaming works. still getting ~10% 500 errors under load.
  → Root cause: embedding generation timeout when Supabase is slow.
  → Fix: Videet adding embedding cache so repeat queries skip the API call.
• CEO insights: ✅ queries all clones in parallel, aggregates sentiment.
• Continual learning: ✅ extracts facts from conversations, saves with embeddings.
• Blocker: need Ella to fix the connection pooling bug.

ELLA (Full-Stack / Integrations):
• Supabase schema: ✅ stable. added text_hash → embedding cache table per Videet's request.
• Slack integration: ✅ webhook working. real-time message → clone memory pipeline.
• Google Drive: ✅ OAuth + sync. found and fixed the token refresh bug (tokens were expiring silently after 1 hour).
• Gmail: ✅ working. shares OAuth with Drive.
• GitHub: ⬜ token auth done, sync not wired up. deprioritized for demo.
• Settings page: ✅ all integrations show connect/disconnect/sync buttons.
• Connection pooling: 🔧 fixing now. bumping pool from 5 → 20 connections.

ANGELINA (Product & Frontend):
• Dark theme: ✅ complete. all 14 component files rethemed. Cursor-inspired.
• Employee chat view: ✅ with memory panel, voice mode, agent thinking steps.
• CEO insights view: ✅ with agent network visualization (animated particles!).
• Knowledge base: ✅ onboarding + offboarding + memory explorer tabs.
• Agent visualization: ✅ SVG topology with real-time event stream.
• Settings page: ✅ dark themed, all integrations listed.
• Demo slides: 🔧 finishing. 3 slides: problem, live demo, tech stack.
• Blocker: none. Just polish and testing.

VIDEET (ML Infrastructure):
• Modal: ✅ Whisper + embedding generation deployed. cold start mitigated with keep-alive.
• Whisper: ✅ large-v3, ~1.8s latency for 30s clips. voice mode working.
• Embeddings: ✅ text-embedding-3-small (1536-d). adding batch support + cache.
  → Found and fixed a dimension bug: was accidentally using text-embedding-3-large (3072-d). 💀
• TTS: ✅ working but robotic. added fallback to show text if TTS fails.
• pgvector: ✅ cosine similarity index created. query time < 50ms for 10K memories.
• Blocker: Modal cold starts on TTS endpoint. added keep-alive ping every 5 min.

DECISIONS MADE:
1. Demo order: CEO insights → clone chat → live Slack learning → onboarding brief
2. James presents (he organized OpenAI Hackathon, knows the judging format)
3. Angelina controls the laptop during demo (she knows all the UI flows)
4. No new features after 6 AM. Only bug fixes and testing.
5. Everyone takes a 30-min nap at 7 AM. Alarms set. DO NOT OVERSLEEP.`,

Problem:
Organizations lose critical knowledge constantly. When employees leave, their expertise walks out the door. When new people join, they spend weeks just figuring out who knows what. Information is scattered across Slack, Drive, email, GitHub — no single system connects it all.

Solution:
GhostWorker is an AI-native memory layer that ingests knowledge from all organizational tools, creates embeddings for semantic search, and serves it through digital twin clones. Every employee gets a clone that can answer questions based on their real communications and documents.

Core Features:
1. Digital Twin Chat — Talk to any employee's AI clone
2. CEO Insights — Multi-clone sentiment analysis for management decisions
3. Continual Learning — Clones get smarter from every interaction
4. Onboarding Briefs — Auto-generated context for new hires
5. Offboarding Handoffs — Knowledge preservation when people leave
6. Memory Explorer — Semantic search across all organizational knowledge

Data Sources:
- Slack (real-time webhook + batch sync)
- Google Drive (OAuth, doc + sheet sync)
- Gmail (OAuth, thread sync)
- GitHub (token auth, commit + PR sync)
- Notion (API key, page sync)

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Next.js 16 + Tailwind CSS v4 + Lucide icons
- Backend: Next.js API routes + Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4o + text-embedding-3-small + Whisper large-v3
- Infra: Modal (ML compute) + Vercel (hosting)`,

      title: "GhostWorker — Pivot Journey & Lessons",
      content: `What We Learned From Pivoting Twice at OpenAI Hackathon 2026

Timeline:
9:30 PM — Hackathon starts. Idea: Ambient Listening AI.
10:00 PM — Start building. Whisper API is fast, ${world.people[3]?.name} sets up Modal pipeline.
12:30 AM — Hit a wall. Chrome kills background audio workers. iOS Safari is hopeless.
12:45 AM — Tense team discussion. ${world.people[3]?.name} wants to push through, ${world.people[0]?.name} says pivot.
1:00 AM — Pivot #1: AI Workforce with post-trained specialized agents.
1:30 AM — Start multi-agent framework. ${world.people[3]?.name} sets up LoRA training on Modal.
3:00 AM — Fine-tuning too slow. Each agent takes 20 min. Can't iterate.
3:15 AM — Another tense discussion. We've now burned 5.5 hours on two ideas.
3:30 AM — Pivot #2: GhostWorker — AI-native memory layer. Everyone agrees (finally).
4:00 AM — Supabase schema done, RAG pipeline running, ${world.people[2]?.name} starts frontend.
5:00 AM — Clone chat working. First "wow" when James's clone answers from Slack data.
6:00 AM — ${world.people[1]?.name} finishes Slack + Drive integrations.
7:00 AM — Continual learning, onboarding, offboarding all functional.
8:00 AM — Angelina finishes Cursor-inspired dark theme UI (she literally works at Cursor). Looks like a real product.
9:00 AM — Demo rehearsed. We're actually proud of this.

Key Insight:
The pivots weren't wasted time. Ambient listener → we reused Whisper for voice mode. AI workforce → we reused agent-to-agent communication for clone consultation. Both fed into GhostWorker.

Meta-lesson: We built a memory layer because we experienced the pain of losing context during pivots — and realized every org has the same problem at scale.`,
