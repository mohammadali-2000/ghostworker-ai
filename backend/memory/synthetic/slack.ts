ML infra (Modal, embeddings, pgvector) too.\n${e}: I own product and long-term startup potential — what we're building for, enterprise use cases, integrations (Slack, Drive, Gmail), Supabase schema, OAuth.\n\neveryone good? no ambiguity. each of us is the expert in our area.`,

    `@here quick ownership check:\n\nMemory layer (episodic, mem0, semantic): ${j}\nRAG & long-term agent capabilities: ${a}\nTool use & agentic capabilities: ${v}\nProduct & startup potential, integrations: ${e}\n\nif you need something from someone else's area, ask them first. we don't have time for merge conflicts at 4am.`,

    `${j}: hey ${e} quick question — for the clone chat endpoint, should I write directly to Supabase or go through your API layer?\n${e}: go through my API layer please. I have a helper in lib/core/supabase.ts that handles connection pooling. if you write directly you'll hit the free tier connection limit when CEO insights queries all 4 clones at once.\n${j}: ah good call. I'll import your supabase client. also can you add a memories.search() function that takes an embedding vector and returns top-K? I need it for the RAG pipeline.\n${e}: yeah I'll have that ready in 30 min. what's the embedding dimension?\n${j}: 1536 — text-embedding-3-small. thanks!`,

    `${a}: ${v} I need the agent network visualization to show particles moving between nodes when agents communicate. can you expose the agent-to-agent events from the insights pipeline?\n${v}: the insights stream already emits stage events (planning, querying, aggregating). I can add agent_communication events with from/to/message fields.\n${a}: perfect. I'll render them as animated SVG particles on bezier curves between the nodes. the topology is already laid out.\n${v}: that's actually sick. send me a screenshot when it's working.\n${a}: will do. also — can we make the node glow effect pulse when an agent is active? I want it to feel like watching a neural network think.\n${v}: lol you've been at Cursor too long. but yeah, we can do that.`,

    `${e}: @here integration status update:\n✅ Slack — bot token auth + webhook working. messages sync to clone memories in real-time.\n✅ Google Drive — OAuth flow complete. syncs docs and sheets.\n✅ Gmail — shares OAuth with Drive. pulls last 50 email threads.\n⬜ GitHub — token auth done, need to wire up repo/commit sync.\n⬜ Notion — API key auth works, page sync partially done.\n❌ Jira — not started, probably won't make it for demo.\n\n${j} — for the demo we only need Slack + Drive + Gmail working reliably. GitHub/Notion are nice-to-have.\n${a} — the settings page UI is ready for all 6 integrations though, so it LOOKS like we support everything.\n${j}: smart. let's focus on Slack for the live demo moment and Drive for showing document context in citations.`,

    // ── Technical handoff conversations ──
    `${v}: ${j} the embedding generation is bottlenecking the clone chat. when a user sends a message, we generate the embedding inline before doing the vector search. that adds ~300ms of latency.\n${j}: can we pre-compute embeddings for the chat history and only generate one for the new message?\n${v}: yeah, or we could batch the embedding calls. text-embedding-3-small supports batch inputs — up to 2048 in one API call.\n${j}: let's do batched. I'll refactor the search endpoint to collect all the text first, then make one embedding call.\n${v}: also, I set up an embedding cache in Supabase — if we've seen the exact same text before, we skip the API call entirely. should help with the demo where judges might ask the same question.\n${j}: 🔥 that's clutch. ${e} can you add a cache lookup table to the schema?\n${e}: already on it. adding a text_hash -> embedding index.`,

    `${j}: ${a} the CEO insights view needs to show the streaming stages — planning, querying each clone, aggregating results. right now it just shows a spinner.\n${a}: I built a StageIndicator component with checkmarks for completed stages and a spinner for the active one. but I need the stage events from your streaming endpoint.\n${j}: my endpoint emits SSE events with type: "stage", "plan", "employee_response", and "aggregation". you can parse them in the EventSource listener.\n${a}: perfect. I'll also add the agent network visualization above the results. ${v} built the topology with animated particles — it shows which clone is being queried in real-time.\n${j}: wait that's actually amazing for the demo. judges can SEE the AI system thinking. let's make sure it's prominent.\n${a}: it is. it's the first thing you see when you click "Run Analysis".`,

    `${e}: ${j} heads up — the Slack webhook is hitting a race condition. when multiple messages come in fast, the memory extraction creates duplicate entries because the embeddings haven't been indexed yet.\n${j}: ah classic. can you add a dedup check on the external_id before inserting?\n${e}: yeah, I'll add an ON CONFLICT clause to the Supabase upsert. also adding a processing queue so we don't hammer the embedding API.\n${j}: good. the memory extraction also needs to tag which clone the memory belongs to. right now it's attributing everything to the first clone.\n${e}: oh that's a bug in my webhook handler. I'm matching on email address but the lookup is case-sensitive. fixing now.\n${v}: while you're at it, can you increase the Supabase connection pool? I keep getting "too many connections" when I run the embedding batch job.\n${e}: done. bumped from 5 to 20.`,

I've had 4 Red Bulls and my heart is doing something weird.\n${a}: Ella that's concerning. you should drink water.\n${e}: I'll drink water AND green tea. compromise.\n${v}: it's 3am and we're debating beverage choices. this is peak hackathon energy.\n${j}: at least we're not debating which idea to build anymore. progress.`,

    `${v}: wait ${a} you literally work at Cursor?? why didn't you lead with that\n${a}: lol yeah I'm on the Code Quality team. why?\n${v}: because I've been using Cursor for like 6 months and it's the best IDE I've ever used. can you get me a referral?\n${a}: haha maybe after we win OpenAI Hackathon. also that's why I made the dark theme look like Cursor's UI — it's the only aesthetic I trust at this point.\n${j}: honestly it looks really good. the warm beige accent color is 🤌\n${e}: agreed. it went from "hackathon project" to "actual product" when Angelina did the retheme.\n${a}: thanks! working at Cursor taught me that polish matters more than people think. judges make snap judgments in the first 10 seconds.`,

    `${j}: fun fact: I organized OpenAI Hackathon last year. I literally set up the judging rubric.\n${v}: wait so you know exactly what judges look for??\n${j}: yeah. they care about: 1) does the demo work live 2) is the problem real 3) is the solution novel 4) can you explain it in one sentence. in that order.\n${a}: so "does the demo work" is literally #1? that's why you keep pushing us to cut scope.\n${j}: EXACTLY. I saw a team last year with a genuinely brilliant idea — decentralized federated learning on mobile — and they lost because their demo crashed. the team that won had a simpler idea but a flawless 3-minute demo.\n${e}: ok that's actually really helpful context. I'm prioritizing bug fixes over new features for the rest of the night.\n${v}: fine fine fine. I'll stop trying to add LoRA fine-tuning and focus on making the embeddings fast.`,

    `${v}: ${j} random question — how is the SAIL lab? I'm thinking about applying for research there next year.\n${j}: it's great honestly. I'm working with [redacted] on LLM post-training. the vibe is very "build things and publish" which I like.\n${v}: nice. at HAN Lab we're more on the efficiency side — accelerating diffusion language models. different angle but related.\n${j}: yeah our work is actually complementary. your model acceleration stuff could make our post-training methods way more practical. we should collab after OpenAI Hackathon.\n${v}: down. also can we please get back to coding? it's 2am and I just realized the embedding dimensions are wrong.\n${j}: lmao yes. what dimension are you seeing?\n${v}: 3072 instead of 1536. I think I accidentally used text-embedding-3-large.\n${j}: 💀 that explains why the pgvector index was so slow.`,

    `${e}: @here just a heads up — I found a bug where the Google OAuth tokens expire after 1 hour and the Drive sync silently fails. I'm adding a token refresh flow now.\n${a}: oh is THAT why the Drive docs disappeared from the clone's context earlier??\n${e}: yeah, sorry about that. the refresh token was stored but I wasn't using it. fixed in 10 min.\n${j}: ${e} while you're in the auth code, can you also add a "sync status" indicator to the settings page? so we can see when each integration last synced.\n${e}: good idea. I'll add a last_synced_at column to the integrations table and show it in the UI.\n${a}: I'll add a little green dot / red dot next to each integration in the settings page. easy visual indicator.`,

    `${a}: ok the demo narrative is:\n"GhostWorker is an agentic AI-native memory layer for enterprise. We build AI clones of every employee — each with specialized knowledge. James owns the memory layer: episodic memory, mem0, semantic memory. I own RAG and the long-term capabilities of the agent. Videet owns tool use and agentic capabilities. Ella owns product and long-term startup potential. The clones capture organizational knowledge and serve it through digital twins."\n\n${j} does that work for the intro?\n${j}: yes. clear ownership and a real product thesis. judges will get it.\n${v}: and the agentic piece is the differentiator — clones that can use tools and consult each other, not just answer from RAG.\n${e}: the startup potential angle is real. we're not just a hackathon project.\n${a}: ok I'll make the slides. 3 slides max: problem, demo, tech stack. everything else is live demo.`,

    `${v}: yo has anyone seen my charger? I left it near the snack table.\n${a}: which one, there are like 40 chargers on that table\n${v}: the USB-C one with the MIT sticker on it\n${j}: I think Ella borrowed it. she's at the far table near the window.\n${e}: guilty. returning it now. also ${v} your Modal deployment just timed out — I saw the error in the logs.\n${v}: oh no. which endpoint?\n${e}: the /api/voice/synthesize one. TTS is returning 504s.\n${v}: ugh it's the Modal cold start. the container takes 30 seconds to spin up. I'll add a keep-alive ping.\n${j}: can you also add a fallback? if TTS fails, just show the text response without audio. the demo can't crash because of voice mode.`,

    `${j}: @here it's 7am. demo is in 2.5 hours. status check:\n${a}: frontend is done. all views working. dark theme ✅. agent visualization ✅. responsive ✅.\n${e}: integrations are stable. Slack webhook ✅. Drive sync ✅. Gmail ✅. Settings page ✅.\n${v}: ML infra is good. embeddings fast ✅. Whisper working ✅. TTS has a fallback now ✅. pgvector optimized ✅.\n${j}: RAG pipeline ✅. clone chat streaming ✅. insights pipeline ✅. continual learning ✅. synthetic data ✅.\n\nonly known issue: clone chat still 500s ~10% of the time under load. ${v} and I are on it.\n\n${a}: can we rehearse the demo at 8am? I want to run through it twice before judging.\n${j}: yes. everyone take a 30-min power nap and meet back at 8. set alarms. DO NOT OVERSLEEP.`,

    `${e}: ${j} question — for the offboarding handoff pack, should I pull data from all memory sources or just the clone's top memories?\n${j}: all sources. the handoff should show everything the departing person owns — Slack channels they're active in, Drive docs they authored, Jira tickets assigned to them, key decisions they made.\n${e}: ok so I need to query by author/assignee across all source types. that's a different query than the clone chat which does semantic search.\n${j}: yeah. for offboarding you want structured retrieval (filter by person) not semantic search. can you add a getMemoriesByAuthor() function?\n${e}: on it. also adding getMemoriesBySource() so we can filter by Slack vs Drive vs email.\n${a}: from the frontend side, I'm rendering ownership areas as cards with status badges (active/transitioning/needs-owner). each card shows the suggested new owner if the memory layer has enough context to recommend one.\n${j}: 🔥 that's exactly the UX. ship it.`,

    `${v}: guys I just realized both ${a} and I are IOAI gold medalists and we're building an AI hackathon project. the judges are going to expect something insanely good.\n${a}: no pressure right? lol\n${j}: honestly that's a selling point. "built by two IOAI gold medalists, a SAIL researcher, and a full-stack engineer who made all the integrations actually work."\n${e}: hey I'll take "made the integrations actually work" as a compliment\n${v}: it IS a compliment. the number of hackathon projects that have a beautiful demo but fake backend is... most of them.\n${j}: yeah GhostWorker actually connects to real Slack and real Drive. that's our differentiator. it's not a mockup.\n${a}: and the UI isn't a mockup either. every button does something. I tested every flow.\n${e}: the settings page even has working OAuth! you can connect your real Google account! most teams just hardcode API keys.`,

    `${a}: ${e} the clone chat input has a weird bug — when you press Enter it submits but the textarea doesn't clear. can you check the API response?\n${e}: hmm the API is returning 200 with the streaming response. it's probably a frontend state issue.\n${a}: oh wait you're right. I was setting the input to "" before the stream started but the onChange handler was overwriting it. fixed.\n${j}: while you two are debugging the chat, can someone test the CEO insights view? I just pushed a change to the aggregation logic and I want to make sure the themes still make sense.\n${v}: I'll test it. what query should I use?\n${j}: try "If we discontinue Meridian Analytics, what will employees think?" — that's our demo query.\n${v}: running it now... ok the agent visualization is fire. particles flying between nodes. themes look good. sentiment bar is rendering. one issue: the "oppose" percentage says 67% but the theme cards only show 3 employees. should be more.\n${j}: ah that's because I'm only querying the first 4 clones. let me fix the limit.`,
