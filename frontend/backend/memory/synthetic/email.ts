Ran some quick benchmarks on Whisper models for the ambient listener:

- whisper-large-v3: 1.8s for 30s clip, ~95% accuracy
- distil-whisper-large: 0.9s for 30s clip, ~89% accuracy
- whisper-small: 0.3s for 30s clip, ~78% accuracy

I think large-v3 is the move for demo quality. The latency is fine if we're batching every 30 seconds instead of real-time streaming.

Modal costs are negligible — like $0.003 per transcription call.

Let me know if you want to test with different audio conditions (noisy venue, multiple speakers, etc).

Bad news on the Chrome audio capture front. The MediaRecorder API works fine for active recording, but there's no way to keep it running when the tab loses focus without a service worker hack.

Options:
1. Chrome extension with background permissions (adds 2-3 hours of work)
2. Desktop Electron wrapper (not a web app anymore)
3. Just do active recording with a button press (defeats the "ambient" part)

Honestly I think option 3 is where we'll end up. Which makes this just... a voice recorder with AI.

Here's my proposal for the agent coordination layer:

1. User query comes in
2. Intent classifier picks the domain (legal, finance, engineering, product)
3. Coordinator dispatches to the specialized agent
4. Agent responds with domain-grounded answer + citations
5. If the agent needs cross-domain context, it can query another agent

I've got the coordinator working locally. The routing is just a simple GPT-4o-mini call with function calling — fast and cheap.

The open question is: how do we show the specialization in a 3-minute demo? Just different system prompts won't be visually impressive.

Thoughts?

Just finished first round of LoRA fine-tuning for the specialized agents:

- Legal agent: 500 training examples, 22 min on A100, loss converged at 0.8
- Finance agent: 500 examples, 19 min, loss at 0.9 (needs more data)
- Engineering agent: didn't finish — Modal timed out after 30 min

The results are... fine? The legal agent can cite cases accurately now but the finance agent still hallucinates numbers.

Problem: each iteration is 20 min. At a hackathon, that means we can only do ~3 training runs before demo time. Not enough to iterate properly.

I still think this is the right approach long-term but maybe not for a 12-hour hackathon.

Locking these in so there's zero ambiguity about who owns what:

JAMES (ML & Backend Lead):
→ RAG pipeline (ingest, chunk, embed, search)
→ Clone chat streaming API
→ CEO insights multi-agent pipeline
→ Continual learning / memory extraction
→ LLM prompts and prompt engineering
→ Demo presentation and strategy

ELLA (Full-Stack / Integrations):
→ Supabase schema and database
→ ALL integration APIs (Slack, Drive, Gmail, GitHub, Notion)
→ OAuth flows and authentication
→ Webhook handlers
→ Settings page backend
→ Connection pooling and API reliability

ANGELINA (Product & Frontend):
→ ALL React/Next.js UI components
→ Dark theme (Cursor-inspired)
→ Chat view, insights view, knowledge base view
→ Agent network visualization
→ Layout, sidebar, navigation
→ Demo slides and narrative

VIDEET (ML Infrastructure):
→ Modal deployments for ML compute
→ Whisper transcription pipeline
→ Embedding generation and caching
→ Voice synthesis (TTS)
→ pgvector optimization
→ Performance tuning

If your feature depends on someone else's area, message them directly.
If something breaks at 4am, check this list before waking everyone up.

${from.name}`,

    {
      subject: "Re: Who handles backend for GhostWorker?",
      body: `${to.name},

Backend responsibilities are split between three people:

• James handles all the AI/ML backend — the RAG pipeline, clone chat API, insights streaming, and continual learning. If you need to change how the LLM responds or how memories are searched, talk to James.

• Ella handles the infrastructure backend — Supabase database, all integration APIs (Slack, Drive, Gmail), OAuth, webhooks. If something returns a 500 error or the database is slow, talk to Ella.

• Videet handles ML infrastructure — Modal deployments, Whisper, embeddings, voice synthesis, pgvector. If embeddings are wrong or Modal is timing out, talk to Videet.

Angelina handles the entire frontend — every React component, the dark theme, all the views. She doesn't touch backend code.

In short: James = AI logic, Ella = data plumbing, Videet = ML compute, Angelina = UI.

Since we're locked into GhostWorker now and the demo is in a few hours, I want to share my honest assessment so we're aligned.

What I think is working:
${from.opinions?.[0] || "The memory layer concept is solid and highly demoable."}

What I'm worried about:
${from.opinions?.[3] || "We might be trying to show too much in 3 minutes."}

What I'd change if we had more time:
${from.opinions?.[7] || "I'd want better test coverage and more robust error handling."}

I'm committed to shipping this regardless. Let's make it great.

Good question. Here's what I think:

${from.opinions?.[1] || "I think we learned a lot from the pivot journey."}

${from.opinions?.[4] || "There's definitely a real product here."}

Beyond the hackathon, I think the digital twin concept could be huge for enterprise knowledge management. Every company with more than 50 people has the problem we're solving.

Thoughts?
${from.name}`,

    {
      subject: "GhostWorker — Supabase schema finalized",
      body: `Team,

Schema is locked. Here's what we're running with:

Tables:
- clones: employee digital twins (name, personality, expertise, suggested_questions)
- memories: unified knowledge store (content, embedding, source_type, clone_id, memory_type)
- messages: chat history per clone
- integrations: OAuth tokens + API keys for data sources

Key design decision: everything goes in the memories table with type discriminators (document, chunk, fact, category). No separate tables per source. This means Slack messages, Drive docs, emails, GitHub commits — all stored the same way with source_metadata for source-specific fields.

pgvector extension is enabled for cosine similarity search on the embedding column.

Updated demo script (3 minutes):

0:00-0:30 — Intro: "Every org has a memory problem. GhostWorker fixes it with AI digital twins."
0:30-1:15 — CEO insights: Ask "What does the team think about our launch?" Show multi-clone sentiment analysis
1:15-2:00 — Clone chat: Chat with a clone, show RAG citations, continual learning panel
2:00-2:30 — Live demo: Send a Slack message, show the clone learning it in real-time
2:30-3:00 — Onboarding brief + closing: "GhostWorker turns scattered knowledge into living memory"

I think we should practice this at least twice before judging starts. Last hackathon I saw a team with an amazing project lose because their demo crashed.

⬜ Notion: API key auth, page sync partially working

For the demo we only need Slack + Drive working reliably. The rest is nice-to-have.

I'm proposing we go with the memory layer idea and LOCK IT. No more pivots. Every minute we spend debating is a minute we're not building.
